      <p> *The consumption of alcohol is for Adults of legal drinking age only. If you choose to drink beverages that contain alcohol please do so responsibly and in moderation. Do not drink and drive. Do not drink excessively. Do not drink while pregnant and do not drink while using medication. Do not drink anytime it could put you or others at risk. United States Dietary Guidelines suggest limiting your intake to two drinks per day for men and one a day for women. Eating a large healthy meal prior to consuming alcohol will help slow the absorption of alcohol. If you or someone you know cannot control the amount that they drink you should not drink, and should seek medical attention. Drinking excessively can impair judgement and cause bodily harm, know your limit..
