            <h5>1. Set up your living room/dining room/kitchen/hallway</h5>
            <p>The playing floor will host the players and it is where the game of True American is played.
                <br>You will need to set up at least twelve spots (if there are more players, more spots will be needed). Anything from couches to chairs can be used.
                <br>Set up the White House. Stack a table with copious amounts of beer with a hard liquor of your choice in the middle. 
                <br>Get lots of Solo cups, a bottle of hot sauce, a thing of moonshine, and blindfolds, don't ask why. 
            </p>
            <h5>2. Pick teams</h5>
            <p>Everyone run to a spot, count to three and have everyone put up a number from 1-3 on their forehead. People with the same number will be on the same team. If there is some idiot who somehow doesn't have a team, have someone volunteer to join them.</p>
            <h5>3. Starting the game</h5>
            <p>Everyone run to a spot.
                <br>Whoever is in the White House is the president. The president will pull two game cards and then one movement card.
            </p>
            <h5>The White House</h5>
            <p>The White House is kind of like the GO spot in Monopoly. Every time you pass by the spot you can refill your cup. The Catch? You must use the beer can that was used by the person before you. It might not fill your cup up all the way but your peers don't need to know that (You can't leave an empty can for your successor, that is just a dick move).</p>
            <h5>The Golden Rule</h5>
            <p>NEVER EVER run out of alcohol. If some catches you without alcohol, they can shout out GEORGE W. BUSH! and send you to Guantanamo Bay, what is Guantanamo Bay you ask?</p>
            <h5>Guantanamo Bay</h5>
            <p>Welcome to hell soldier. You've been caught and now must face the consequences. After every turn you must perform either a truth or dare, you must do this three times before escaping.</p>
